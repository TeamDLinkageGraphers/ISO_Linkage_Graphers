## Introduction 
NEO4j 

The following steps are consistently followed in all Cypher queries provided for different base companies:

Data Loading & Cleaning:
The CSV file is loaded, and necessary fields (Base_Consolidation_Name, Associated_Company_Name, Linkage_Value, and Linkage_Method) are trimmed and extracted. Null or empty values are filtered out.

Company-Specific Filtering:
The query filters rows to isolate records related to one specific base company at a time.

Top Linkage Identification:
For that company:

The data is grouped by linkage method and value.
Frequency of usage is calculated.
The top two most frequently used linkages (e.g., phone numbers, emails) are selected.

Graph Node Creation:

A node is created for the base company.
Linkage method and linkage value nodes are created.
Relationships are established:
Base Company → Linkage Method → Linkage Value.

Associated Companies Connection:
All companies connected via the selected linkage values are added as nodes.
They are linked to the corresponding linkage value.

Final Result:
A subgraph is created that shows how each company connects to others through its top communication linkages.

This logic is repeated across all queries to generate consistent graph structures for each company.
