# Tableau Interactive Company Linkage Dashboard

This dashboard was created in Tableau to visually and interactively explore corporate linkages using graph-based layouts. The goal is to allow investigators, researchers, and analysts to explore how companies are connected based on shared communication identifiers such as email addresses and phone numbers.


##  Overview

The dashboard visualizes **Base Companies** as central nodes and their respective **Associated Companies** as connected nodes using a tree graph layout. Linkage values (emails/phones) are used to reveal hidden patterns of association, and dynamic filters enable deeper exploration.

##  Features & Functionalities

### Tree Graph Visualization
- Built using **Tableau Tree Extension** to create a force-directed radial layout.
- The central node represents the **selected base company**.
- Edges represent linkages, and nodes connected to the center are **associated companies**.

### Linkage Method Color Coding
- **Blue**: Email
- **Orange**: Phone
- Each association line is color-coded based on the type of linkage method.

### Filters and Controls
- **Company Selector**: Dropdown list to choose the base company.
- **Linkage Value Filter**: Checkbox list to filter based on shared email or phone identifiers.
- **Hover Tooltip Extension**: Hover over any node to view details like:
  - Associated company
  - Linkage method
  - Contact value (email/phone)

### Tabular View
- Displays selected base company, associated companies, and linkage metadata side-by-side.
- Updates dynamically based on filters and selections.

## ðŸ›  How It Was Built

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleaned and structured datasets were loaded into Tableau.
   - Each record mapped a base company â†’ linkage value â†’ associated company.

2. **Worksheets Created**:
   - Filter controls for Base Company and Linkage Value.
   - Conditional formatting to apply color for different linkage methods.
   - Summary table for base and associated company relationship.

3. **Tree Extension**:
   - The tree extension was added from Tableau Extension Gallery.
   - Configured to dynamically highlight and reposition nodes based on selection.
   - Hover enhancements added for usability.

4. **Dashboard Assembly**:
   - Combined worksheets, filters, and graph into a single layout.
   - Made interactive using filter actions and extension event listeners.
